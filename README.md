# Weather App in React-Native

## A simple weather App built in React-Native with Weather Underground API
I'm learning React Native, and this is my first project I built. The background image is changing every 10 second.

This App can:
* look up weather for the next 7 days, starting from today;
* look up weather by the city and state, ie. Denver, CO;
![Look up by City&State]('./ReadMeAssets/City_State.png)
![Result]('./ReadMeAssets/DEN.png)
* look up weather by zip code, ie. 80123;

* look up weather by international location, ie. Moscow, RU;
