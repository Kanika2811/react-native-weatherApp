## Weather App in React-Native

### A simple weather App built in React-Native with Weather Underground API
I'm learning React Native, and this is my first project I built. The background image is changing every 10 second.

This App can:
* look up weather for the next 7 days, starting from today;
* look up weather by the city and state, ie. Denver, CO;
* look up weather by zip code, ie. 80123;
* look up weather by international location, ie. Moscow, RU;

![Weather in Denevr, CO](https://github.com/Natalia504/react-native-weatherApp/blob/master/ReadMeAssets/Denver.png)

If the location is empty, misspelled, non-existent, or state is not provided, the error message will show:
